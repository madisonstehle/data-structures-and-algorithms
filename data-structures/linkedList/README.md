# Linked List Implementation
This application is implementation of a Linked List class, and any important methods related to that.

## Challenge
Write a method for the Linked List class which takes a number, `k`, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is `k` from the end of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
    
## Testing
 - Run test files: `npm test linked-list.test.js`
 - Run linter: `npm run lint`

## Credits
- For inspiration on how to approach a "kth from the end" method on singly linked lists, I read [this article](https://www.ideserve.co.in/learn/find-nth-node-from-the-end-of-linked-list) from [IDeserve](https://www.ideserve.co.in/) and [this entry](https://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/to-find-the-kth-to-last-element-of-a-singly-linked-list/) on [Algorithms @tutorialhorizon](https://algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/).
